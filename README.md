This repository contains implementations of four fundamental machine learning algorithms: 
- Gradient Descent
- Linear Regression
- K-means Clustering
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each algorithm is contained in its own folder, which includes Python or Jupyter Notebook files demonstrating the code and usage.
