This repository contains implementations of some machine learning algorithms: 
- Gradient Descent.
- Linear Regression.
- K-means Clustering.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- Decision Tree (classify and regression).
- Naive Bayes.

Each algorithm is contained in its own folder, which includes Python or Jupyter Notebook files demonstrating the code and usage.
